## Description

Pet Social Network (name pending: Animal House or Animal Farm) is an app where users can sign up, then sign in and create a profile where they can add their pet(s) along with descriptions, photos, and pet friends. In addition, the user can organize playdates with other owners' pets, make donation to a local shelter, and make posts about their pet in the newsfeed.

## Challenges

1. queries and mutations were tough, but graphql helped sort out issues
2. we had some problems with git merge conflicts
3. scaling down to mvp was a challenge, but it forced us to code leaner
4. Tim Primmer figured out how to upload images. He decided to use imgur to store the photos.
5. Stripe implementation proved to be too complicated for MVP.
