## User Story

When I sign up and sign in to the app, I want to be able to create a profile.
When I create my profile, I want to be able to add my pet(s) along with my pet's story, description, species, breed, favorite activity (probably napping or eating trash), a photo.
When I click to view other users’ profiles, I can view the information of the user and user’s pet(s). I can also see the user’s posts. 
When I go to the Pawfeed page, I can make posts about my pet and see other user's posts, filter by topics, and reply to individual posts.

## Challenges

1. queries and mutations were tough, but graphql helped sort out issues
2. we had some problems with git merge conflicts
3. scaling down to mvp was a challenge, but it forced us to code leaner
4. Tim Primmer figured out how to upload images. He decided to use imgur to store the photos.
5. Stripe implementation proved to be too complicated for MVP.
